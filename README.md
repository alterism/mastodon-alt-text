## Abstract

The JupyterLab code in this repository aims at analysing the use of alt text (image description) in social media posts published on the Fediverse instance [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/about), on the basis of tthe dataset <cite>[mastodon.social alt text use by client app](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fourtonfish/mastodon-social-alt-text-use-by-client-app)</cite> by [Stefan Bohacek](https://stefanbohacek.com/), published on Kaggle under the [MIT license](https://www.mit.edu/~amini/LICENSE.md).

This project was conceived and carried out by the group “[Alterism](https://github.com/alterism)”, formed by [Cristal Rivera](https://linkedin.com/in/cristal-rivera-picado/) and [Tommaso Marmo](https://tommi.space/), in the context of the [Introduction to Data Science](https://ois2.tlu.ee/tluois/subject/ULP6613-23265) course of the <cite>[Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Societies](https://aissprogram.eu)</cite> master.

Our research focused on understanding image description usage, analyzing it in detail using data science techniquies, and comparing it with literature concerning related topics.
